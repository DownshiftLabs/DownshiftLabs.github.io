title: On Why You Should Hire Me
excerpt: Honestly, I don't have the slightest clue. But why don't you read what I have to say about myself and see if this is someone you'd like to work with?

I'm Denis and together with a few others* I can make things for the web that will help your business. You should hire me for my technical merits, of course! 

If only all collaborations worked that simply... Unfortunately, sometimes company processes and culture can get in the way of getting meaningful units of work done. I want to maximize the value I provide to your team and project and so this is a disclosure of what I'm like.

I am seriously into all things with motors. Specifically, I love to [take my Miata roadster to the track]("https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=track+nc+miata") and [disturb the peace on my supermotard](https://www.google.com/search?q=supermotard+wheelie&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&authuser=0&ei=DCJWUr2oDY3ligKc6oGYCQ). 

I am formally a computer scientist according to the Univeristy of Connecticut, but really I am just [thrilled to be creating for the web](https://github.com/jumph4x).

I do most of my technical work using VIM, tmux and Chrome. If your team already uses VIM, this makes me particularly great to pair with remotely. I am happy taking high level informal direction just as well as strict specifications.
