title: On Teaching, Helping and Speaking Out
excerpt: Our industry has problems it needs to face. Here are some things I have done, will continue doing and things I am considering doing

I write software for a living and I am thoroughly fulfilled in my craft. I am rather privileged to be earning a living the way I am.

Not everyone is a white straight able-bodied financially well-off male. These things matter. Each of the priveleges listed help me achieve social and financial security. Often at the expense of those who are not all those things. I happen to represent what the traditional America is used to seeing in the *successful* workforce. 

I'm talking about traditions such as racism and sexism, of course. I may not have a choice when it comes to others' bias, but I can choose to speak out about this and take some form of action. 

I am a many-times [RailsBridge volunteer](http://railsbridge.org/) and a [2013 SF RailsGirls coach](http://railsgirls.com/sanfrancisco-2013-01-25). While I love both of these initiatives, they offer no long-term mentorship engagement, limiting how much help and influence I can extend to aspiring folk. 

So, reach out to me directly if:

 -   You want to get into the industry and need advice
 -   You want to pair-program Ruby, Git or frontend stuffs (maybe even Python or JS if you're just starting out)
 -   You aspire to be a Ruby on Rails freelancer and need hours, but not sure if you are technical enough
 -   You are learning on your own but could use a tutor here-and-there
 -   You are excited by the prospect of building a website/app but don't know where to start
 -   You really want to become a programmer, but really cannot afford the basics, like a laptop and a place with an Internet connection, or maybe you're looking for books
 -   **You have a more constructive format to suggest to me. I'm listening**

Lots of open source initiatives and free tutorials helped me get started when I was still in Highschool. I want to continue the cycle that rewards those who seek knowledge and self-fulfillment.

I want a future that is more colorful than the bleak SF boys club that I see right now. I'm Denis, how can I help?
