title: Develop Talent Before Product
excerpt: I enjoy working with technical developers just as I do with end-users. If your company is going through aggressive on-boarding or you're simply looking to develop existing talent, talk to me.

I love distilling my experience into consumable bits of wisdom.

I've instructed at SF RailsGirls, RailsBridge and spoken at SpreeConf. Between this and my personal mentorship projects, I've taught at every imaginable experience level. No matter what your internal talent pool looks like, I can make training accessible and engaging. Currently I like talking about responsive web interfaces, Rails backends, AngularJS frontend basics and building performance web apps.

## A Note to Founders

I enjoy working with founders/engineers on extremely early stage products. Whether you are non-technical co-founder looking to deepen understanding of your technical challenge or an engineer looking to exchange ideas before investing resources into a pattern, talk to me. Whether you're worried about securing investments or looking to beat out a competitor, I will happily augment your team to bootstrap your concept and help you minimize time to market.
