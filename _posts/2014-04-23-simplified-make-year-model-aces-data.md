The North American [AAIA
ACES](http://www.aftermarket.org/technology/aces.aspx) standard is a
huge advance for the automotive industry as it allows for meaningful
and
granular data exchange between manufacturers, suppliers and retailers.
The format is carefully curated and updated monthly to reflect new
additions, deprecations and alterations as maintained by the subscriber
base.

As wonderful as it is for established industry players, the $3250 annual
upfront pricetag is aweful for experimental projects and new
market-probing players. 

Downshift Labs is here with a solution. **We will provide small companies
with a simplified version at enormous savings.**

The simplified version includes only the following relationally mapped
(or de-normalized) data:

1.   Model
1.   Year
1.   SubModel
1.   Vehicle/Vessel Type
1.   Market

The data is available in all popular formats, including a MySQL or
Postgres friendly .sql dump, a .csv export, even a MongoDB de-normalized version. For an extra fee will will conform the data to your company's specific needs.
