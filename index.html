<p>I'm Denis and <a href="#/people.html">together with a few others</a> I can make things for the web that will help your business.</p>
<p>I am seriously into all things with motors. Specifically, I love to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=autocross+nc+miata">autocross my Miata roadster</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=supermoto+wheelie">disturb the peace on my supermotard</a>. Spot them in the background along with other various vehicles from my past. </p>
<p>I am formally a computer scientist according to the Univeristy of Connecticut, but really I am just <a href="#/work.html">thrilled to be creating for the web</a>.</p>
