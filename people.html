<h2>Denis</h2>

<p>That's me. I'm a generalist. Here are some of the things I do:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>AAIA ACES implementations</li>
    <li>High URL-count SEO strategy</li>
    <li>Custom eCommerce deployments</li>
    <li>Frontend benchmarking and optimization</li>
    <li>Responsive mobile interfaces</li>
    <li>Create behavior specification coverage</li>
    <li>And, of course, everything Rails</li>
    <li>Screen scraping, data extraction</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>In a lot of ways I'm a data nerd, so one of the things I knew I wanted to make a long time ago was a resource for car enthusiasts to research and compare cars <em>on paper</em>. I did just that with <a href="http://www.streetspecs.com">Street Specs</a>.</p>

<p>In between client work, I try to cancel some of the echo chamber effect by reading up on Erlang.</p>

<h2>Roman</h2>

<p>Roman is my secret weapon. He is a condensed matter physicist from Tver, Russia. I first found him contributing to the Spree Commerce project and after reviewing his open source work decided we'd make a good team. We've been kicking ass together since. </p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical bugs, hardcore backtracing</li>
    <li>Extending behavior of existing systems</li>
    <li>Anything Rails</li>
    <li>Assistance migrating from PHP</li>
  </ul>
</p>
