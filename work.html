<h2>FCP Stores</h2>

<p>Our flagship product, FCP Stores is one of the largest Spree deployments we know of. It uses a ton of extensions and has been through a lot of Spree revisions, dating all the way back to 0.0.11. It is currently serving well over a million pageviews a month while spreaheading the industry with performance and accuraxcy.</p>

<p>This project is an all out package for a client looking to transition from a contract based on dated technology, including these features and more:
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule-driven phase-by-phase URL transitioning while measuring latent SEO impact</li>
    <li>Multi domain architecture: <a href="http://www.fcpimport.com">FCP Import</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.fcpeuro.com">FCP Euro</a></li>
    <li>Full text indexed and faceted for ultimate performance and flexibility</li>
    <li>Page generation time average at only 175-250ms</li>
    <li>Integration with a legacy ERP system</li>
    <li>Battle tested SEO strategy</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Street Specs</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.streetspecs.com">Street Specs</a> is an old project of mine which combines my screen scraping expertise with an intuitive UI, allowing non-technical users to navigate the data behind the cars around them. By dismantling the obstacles between consumers and cars I hope create more happy drivers and maybe even encourage people to have some fun.</p>

<p>Some quick facts about the project:
  <ul>
    <li>Uses Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework</li>
    <li>Extracts all data from publically viewable websites and normalzies all data automatically</li>
    <li>Allows comparison of cars, creating spider graphs using Google's Chart API</li>
  </ul>
</p>    

<h2>Rails Canonical</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jumph4x/rails-canonical">Canonicalization of URLs</a> is a huge topic for SEO professionals but very few frontend developers seem to take the precautionary steps in order to avoid large losses for the client. Having seen one too many Rails applications suffering from this, I decided to build a quick, conservative-by-default, configurable implementation of the canonical tag developers can drop in now and worry about later.</p>

<p>Though not as large of a threat as it is now, Google and other SEs used to punish websites found distributing same or similar content under multiple URLs. This rails gem helps by:
  <ul>
    <li>Enforcing trailing slashes for index actions</li>
    <li>Serving canonical URLs while ignoring parameters by default</li>
    <li>Whitelist-configurable to specify extra collection routes</li>
    <li>Designed to shield against duplicate content attacks</li>
  </ul>
</p>
